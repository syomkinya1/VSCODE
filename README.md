## How to use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code**
3. Choose the language of your choice.
4. Add the input to **input.txt** file.
5. Run the code!
6. Output will be generated in **output.txt** file.

## Points to remember
1. All the three files **main.cpp**, **Main.java**, **main.py** contain a template code which first accepts the number of testcases and calls a function **solve()** where you can write your code.
2. If the input format is different from this one, please make necessary changes to the **main()** function.
